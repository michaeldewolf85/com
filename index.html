    <a href="#">Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT!</a>
    <p>Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! The other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take out its family. This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE.</p>
    <p>You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text.</li>
      <li>We are going to make placeholder text great again.</li>
      <li>Greater than ever before.</li>
      <li>Trump Ipsum is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslim text entering your website.</li>
      <li>Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites.</p>
